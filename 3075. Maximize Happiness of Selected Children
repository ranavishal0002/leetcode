## You are given an array happiness of length n, and a positive integer k. There are n children standing in a queue, where the ith child has happiness value happiness[i].
## You want to select k children from these n children in k turns. In each turn, when you select a child, the happiness value of all the children that have not been selected
## till now decreases by 1. Note that the happiness value cannot become negative and gets decremented only if it is positive.Return the maximum sum of the happiness values of
## the selected children you can achieve by selecting k children.
