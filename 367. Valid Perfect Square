# Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {

        
         for (int i =1; i<=num/i; i++){
            if(i*i==num){
                return true;
            }
         }
         return false;
        
    }
}
